## Search Algorithms


#### How Many Searches
>Given a sorted list `3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18` and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find `8`.

`10, 6, 8`

>...try to find `16`.

`10, 14, 16`

#### Searching in a BST
>Given a binary search tree whose in-order and pre-order traversals are respectively `14 15 19 25 27 35 79 89 90 91` and `35 25 15 14 19 27 89 79 91 90`. What would be its postorder traversal?

`14, 19 15, 27,, 25, 79, 90, 91, 89, 35`
